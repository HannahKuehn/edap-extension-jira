# EDAP extension for Jira - Checklist App

The app presents information on possible ethical aspects that are relevant to the project. This information can subsequently be used to fill out the EDAP template.
The developer will check the statements that relate to the system they are working on and the checklist will then present the information that corresponds to the checked points.
The information base can be extended with information from different sources to make the checklist more complete.
The app was developed with Atlassian Connect.
